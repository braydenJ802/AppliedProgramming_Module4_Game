# AppliedProgramming_Module4_Game
 
# Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a small game consisting of basic input and a movable object, with an incrementing score for game logic.

The game itself is very simple at the moment. It consists of a single red block that starts on a light blue ground pane. The block is constrained to vertical motion and so the player can jump and fall back to the same position on the ground. Each jump increments the score, which is stored in a singleton. The score label continuously updates the text displayed. The only other label is a test of the network connection, which displays "Network Connected: true" if the server has connected properly, and displays "Network Connected: false" if the server is not yet connected.
